# Awesome pLMs

A curated list of Protein Language Models (pLMs) and related resources. (Work in progress)

## Introduction

Protein Language Models (pLMs) are machine learning models that leverage natural language processing techniques to understand and generate protein sequences. These models have shown promise in various applications, including protein structure prediction, function annotation, and de novo protein design.
